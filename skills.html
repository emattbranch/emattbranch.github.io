       <p>I will graduate in May 2022 from the University of Baltimore with an <span class="bold">Interaction Design and Information Architecture</span> MS degree. In addition I have a <span class="bold">UX Design</span> graduate certificate from the University of Baltimore, an <span class="bold">Internet Programming</span> certificate from Trident Technical College, and a <span class="bold">Computing in the Arts</span> BA from the College of Charleston Honors College. Below is a collection of my favorite skills.</p>

        <h4>Research methods</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Quantitative research design</li>
          <li>Qualitative methods (contextual inquiry, surveys & questionnaires)</li>
          <li>Eye tracking</li>
          <li>Statistical analysis (descriptive, inferential, data graphing)</li>
        </ul>

          <p>I have studied research design including observational, correlational, and experimental. Although observational has been the most applicable to my design projects so far, knowing how to ensure a research study is experimentally valid has improved my research skills in all areas. Balancing control of variables with ecological validity is critical and plays into every study design. </p>
          <p>Observational studies I have completed include task analysis, contextual inquiry, and surveys. Each of these requires interpreting participant responses to make valid design choices. Quantitative measures can help with interpreting results; I have often used a combination of the two in a single study. Eye tracking is a great example, as interview questions are necessary to interpret the metrics.</p>
          <p>In addition, I have studied descriptive and inferential statistics through dependent samples t-Test and one-way ANOVA.</p>

        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Sketches, wireframes, paper prototypes</li>
          <li>Storyboards, roleplay walkthroughs</li>
          <li>User journey maps, stakeholder maps, flow diagrams</li>
        </ul>

          <p>I find the creation process very rewarding and enjoy working as part of a team.  I have experience using many design methods and exercises to help with this process; some are more helpful at the beginning to develop ideas, while others are best as evaluative tools throughout the process.</p>
          <p>I have found sketching helpful in every project I've been involved with to communicate with other members of the team. Collaborative idea boards such as Mural have also been a useful way of collecting research, images, and ideas remotely. Storyboards and roleplay exercises have allowed the team to really dive into the experience during the prototype development stage, and Iâ€™ve made frequent use of personas and user journeys to consolidate gathered data and keep the team focused. I have also created flow diagrams, stakeholder maps, and animated storyboards to communicate my ideas to stakeholders, and walked through paper or cardboard prototypes with team members to find areas for improvement. Regardless of the chosen method, I find it is most important to form the goal first, then find the best method to achieve it.</p>

        <h4>Psychology study</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fundamentals of neurodesign</li>
          <li>Fundamentals of persuasive design
          <li>Accessibility evaluation</li>
        </ul>

          <p>I have greatly enjoyed every opportunity to study the interaction of psychology and design in my graduate program. I find the relatively new field of Neurodesign to be fascinating. Through these classes I have studied the overall structure and function of the brain, including different mechanisms such as the strong connection between memory and emotion, and the biological workings of cognitive load. This knowledge is especially useful for persuasive design; I have learned that every design choice has an influence on the end user's decisions. I strive to be an ethical designer who avoids manipulating users or creating negative psychological effects beyond the design itself. </p>
          <p>Accessibility can sometimes seem like a separate field than design, but I believe it is essential to creating a universally positive experience. For example, applying above average contrast not only ensures that contrast-impaired people have access, but improves the experience for everyone. I have completed in depth accessibility analysis in a few projects using the browser WAV tool in conjunction with W3C accessibility standards. There is always more that can be done to improve in this area, and I aim to make it a central focus of my work.</p>

        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Web development: HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
          <li>Object Oriented Programming: beginner Java and Python</li>
        </ul>

          <p>I have experience developing static websites (for example, I built this portfolio with plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript...check out the inspect tool to see the code). In the past I have used this skill to create high fidelity mockups, interactive components, and to develop testing material. My experience with code and programming allows me to communicate clearly with developers and stakeholders, as I have a basic understanding of the technical process behind creating an interface.</p>
          <p>As an undergraduate student I learned the fundamentals of the OOP paradigm, mainly in Java and Python. For my capstone project I used the Jython JEM library and IDE to develop a tool that enabled a user to create a musical composition by drawing on an image. </p>

          <h4>Design software</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Wireframe tools (Lucidchart, Balsamiq)</li>
            <li>Adobe (XD, Illustrator Photoshop)</li>
            <li>Ideation tools (Mural, Miro)</li>
            <li>Workflow (Slack, Teams, Github)</li>
          </ul>

            <p>I have experience using common design software to create high and low fidelity prototypes, mockups, and interactive components. All case studies in this portfolio were created in collaboration with team members, usually working remotely on the same software. Each project involved a different workflow and communication setup. I am most familiar with a combination of Slack and Google drive to share documents for planning.</p>
            <p>I am most interested in designing layout and organization of information, as I think these aspects can make or break usability. Good layout and good organization directly effects wayfinding, as well as improving the overall brand. I have used software to present designs both as part of a prototypying process and as an evaluative research tool (to compare wireframe layouts with competitors, for example). </p>
