      <p>Current student of UX Design at the University of Baltimore. Past student of Computing in the Arts at College of Charleston.
      I am interested in the intersection of art, social action, and computers; I want to make positive change in my community using 
      technology to captivate and delight people. Most recently I've been thinking about persuasive design and how it can be used to 
      improve communication on social media platforms.</p>
